(Views.py)

Model Data Retrieval (get_model_data): This function provides all the necessary model data (documents, forms, related entities like ministers and governments) 
for both the view rendering and filtering. It gives you access to everything you need for rendering the page and serializing data for AJAX responses.

Document Filtering (filter_documents): This function applies the filtering logic to the documents based on the user's query parameters, allowing the view 
to present the filtered documents based on the search criteria. It's a utility function to clean up and centralize filtering logic.

Data Fetching (data_fetcher): data_fetcher takes over when an AJAX request is made, fetching documents and related data (like ministers and governments) 
from the database. It applies optimizations, serializes the documents, and returns the data in JSON format. It's ideal for dynamic pages 
that need to update without reloading the entire page (e.g., using JavaScript for filtering).

File Checking (has_files): This function is used to determine if a document has files (such as PDFs or attachments). 
It ensures that the correct file-related data is serialized in the data_fetcher response and provides logic to conditionally display file download links in templates.
